== Description ==

It has never been easier to add progressive web app features (PWA) to your WordPress website. It even supports [Accelerate Mobile Pages (AMP)](https://www.ampproject.org/) and is compatible with [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/)!

= Add to homescreen =

Provide an **integrated** user experience!

Progressive WordPress makes it easy to encourage users to add your website to their homescreen. But that's not all. It also allows you to control the display behaviour of your website so it will be shown without any browser elements. Just like a native app.
= Offline usage =

Make your website **reliable**. Even on flaky internet connections!

No connection? No problem. Progressive WordPress pre-caches all critical assets of your website, as well as all visited resources. So if there's no internet connection it will serve the resources from the local storage. No more error downasaur!

= Push notifications =

**Send push notifications from the WP Admin interface!**

Keep your users **engaged** by sending push notifications!

You just published new content and you want to let everyone know? Why not send a push notification? Progressive WordPress has an integrated connection to Firebase that lets you manage registered devices and send push notifications to all or selected devices!

** Support for OneSignal**
Since Version 2.1.0 Progressive WordPress fully supports [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/). It detects if the [OneSignal WordPress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/onesignal-free-web-push-notifications/) is active and uses their push messaging functionalities instead.

= ⚡ AMP ready =

Progressive WordPress is the first PWA-Plugin for WordPress that also supports Accelerated Mobile Pages!
It precaches required resources, it adds special AMP caching strategies and it registers the ServiceWorker and the Web App Manifest also on AMP Pages.
Progressive WordPress currently supports [AMP for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/) and [AMP for WP – Accelerated Mobile Pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/).

== Privacy ==
This plugin does not use any Cookies. Also it does not collect any personal information without the following

= Push notification =
If the user subscribes to push notifications, the following informations will be saved inside the WP database:
* Browser and Version
* Operating System (and Version)
* Device
* Push Notification endpoint (a key that will be generated by the browser and the firebase server so push notifications can be sent)

Also if you send push notifications, those will be passed to [firebase cloud messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) and they will send it to the client.

== Developers ==
Progressive WordPress offers a lot of possibilities for developers the extend it the way you need it.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work on AMP sites? =

Yes! Progressive WordPress is the first PWA-Plugin that fully supports AMP! Register ServiceWorker on AMP, Precache AMP resources, use AMP as your web app start URL.
It's currently compatible with [AMP for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/), [AMP for WP – Accelerated Mobile Pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/) and can [easily be configured](https://github.com/SayHelloGmbH/progressive-wordpress#-amp-support) for any AMP plugin or theme.

= How can I use OneSignal? =

By default, progressive WordPress uses google Firebase to send push notifications. Since version 2.1.0 it also supports [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com)!

Progressive WordPress automatically detects if the official [OneSignal plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/onesignal-free-web-push-notifications/) is active and let's you use OneSignal instead of firebase.

= Nothing happens after installation =

1. Are you using a device/browser that supports serviceworkers? [https://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers)

If they are both allright, please open an issue on [https://github.com/SayHelloGmbH/progressive-wordpress/issues](https://github.com/SayHelloGmbH/progressive-wordpress/issues)
