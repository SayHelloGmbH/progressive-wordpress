== Description ==

This plugin adds progressive web app features to your WordPress site.

**This plugin is currently in an open beta phase. I'd love to get some feedback from the community! [nico@sayhello.ch](mailto:nico@sayhello.ch)**

= Web App Manifest =

Create a web app manifest from the WordPress backend. **No coding skills required!**

= Installable =

Provide an awesome app-like experience while making your website installable. Makes use of the data from manifest.json.

= Offline usage =

No connection? No problem!
This feature allows you to provide offline usage for your website.
A copy of each page is stored in the browser cache as the visitor views it. This allows a visitor to load any previously viewed page while they are offline.  The plugin also defines a special “offline page”, which allows you to customize a message and the experience if the app is offline and the page is not in the cache.

= Push notifications =
