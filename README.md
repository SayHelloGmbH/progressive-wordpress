# Progressive WordPress

## Description
This plugin adds Progressive Web App features to your WordPress site and turns it into a PWA.

### Web App Manifest
Create a web app manifest from the WordPress backend. **No coding skills required!**

### Installable
Provide an awesome app-like experience while making your website installable. Therefore it takes the data from the manifest.json.

### Offline usage
No connection? No Problem!  
This feature allows you to provide offline usage for your website.
A copy of each pages is stored in the cache as your visitors view them. This allows a visitor to load any previously viewed page while they are offline. This then adds the „offline page“ that allows you to customize the message and experience if the app is offline, and the page is not in the cache.
