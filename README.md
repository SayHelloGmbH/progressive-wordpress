# Progressive WordPress

## Description
This plugin adds progressive web app features to your WordPress site.

### Web App Manifest
Create a web app manifest using the WordPress backend. **No coding skills required!**

### Installable
Provide an awesome app-like experience while making your website installable. It uses the data defined in manifest.json.

### Offline usage
No connection? No problem!  
This feature allows you to provide offline usage for your website.
A copy of each page is stored in the browser cache as the visitor views it. This allows a visitor to load any previously viewed page while they are offline.  The plugin also defines a special “offline page”, which allows you to customize a message and the experience if the app is offline and the page is not in the cache.
